## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the documentation available at [stratumprotocol.org/docs](https://stratumprotocol.org).

Best way to ask a question is to hop onto our community [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fsEW23wFYs). Two most suitable places to post a question are:
- #newbies-qs and
- #dev, for technical questions, suitable for developers building on top of SRI, or contributing to it.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
  
We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started

### Important Resources About SRI

In order to have a better overview about what SRI covers, have a look at the following resources before getting started with contributions.

  - Stratum V2 Protocol [Specifications](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec). 
    - Studying SV2 specs can take some time and requires effort, but it's the best way to properly understand what SV2 is about and how it's composed.
  - SRI [Getting-started](https://stratumprotocol.org/getting-started/) guide.
    - This can be explored in the meantime of SV2 protocol study, so that it can help getting a general overview about SV2. Moreover, it's the best way to really understand how SRI project is built on. 
  - Stratum V2 [Master Degree Thesis](https://github.com/GitGab19/Stratum-V2-Master-Degree-Thesis) (by [@gitgab19](https://github.com/GitGab19/)).
    - This resource can be useful to get some knowledge about Bitcoin mining, pooled mining protocols history, and Stratum V2.  
  - Stratum V2 Explained - [Videos Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZXAi8dsUIn0GmElOcmqUtgA5psfFIZoO) (by [@plebhash](https://github.com/plebhash)). 
    - This is a series of videos explaining Stratum V2 in depth, which cover the aforementioned topics.

### Project Communications

Most project communications happen in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fsEW23wFYs) server. Communications related to general development typically happen under [dev](https://discord.com/channels/950687892169195530/958814900770205739) channel.

Discussion about specific codebase work happens in GitHub [issues](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/) and on [pull requests](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/pulls/).

Our dev calls are scheduled every Tuesday at 18.00 CET. You can see them in the sidebar under Events on Discord and subscribe to them to be notified.

### Project Structure
It's possible to contribute to SRI opening PRs on three different repositories:
  - [Stratum V2 Reference Implementation](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum)
    - This repo contains our implementation of the SV2 specs, written in Rust.
  - [Stratum V2 Specifications](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-specs)
    - This repo contains the entire SV2 protocol specifications.
  - [SRI website - stratumprotocol.org](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratumprotocol.org)
    - This repo manages our website, containing docs, specs, and getting-started guides.

### Contribution workflow

The SRI project follows an open contributor model, where anyone is welcome to contribute through reviews, documentation, testing, and patches. Follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**

2. **Create a Branch** 

3. **Commit Your Changes**
    
    **Note:** Commits should cover both the issue fixed and the solution's rationale. These [guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) should be kept in mind.

4. **Run Tests, Clippy, and Formatter:** 

    `cargo test`: this command runs the project's test suite. Ensure that all tests pass without errors.

    `cargo clippy`: Clippy is a linter tool for detecting common mistakes and style issues. Address any warnings or errors reported by Clippy.

    `cargo fmt`: this command formats your code according to the project's style guidelines. Make sure to run this command to ensure consistency in code formatting.

5. **Submit a Pull Request:** once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request to the original SRI repository. Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you've made. If your pull request addresses an existing issue, reference the issue number in the description. In order to contribute to the protocol implementation, every PR must be opened against `main` branch.

6. **Review and Iterate** 

7. **Merge and Close:** Once your pull request has been approved and all discussions have been resolved, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the `main` branch. Your contribution will then be officially part of the project. The pull request will be closed, marking the completion of your contribution.

### Your First Code Contribution
>In order to contribute, a basic learning about git and github is needed. If you're not familiar with them, have a look at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/git-and-github-learning-resources to dig into and learn how to use them.

Unsure where to begin contributing to SRI? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

* [Good first issue](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - are issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

Another way to better understand where to focus your contribution is by looking at our roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/stratum-mining/projects/5
