//! Share Validation - Mining Server Abstraction.
//!
//! This module provides types and logic for validating mining shares and tracking share accounting
//! state on a mining server. It is used to determine the outcome of submitted shares, track
//! duplicate submissions, maintain batch acknowledgment state, and compute share statistics for
//! downstream Stratum V2 (SV2) messaging.
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//!
//! - **Share Validation Result**: Encapsulates the result of validating a mining share, including
//!   success, batch acknowledgment, and block discovery.
//! - **Share Validation Error**: Enumerates possible failure reasons when validating a share.
//! - **Share Accounting**: Tracks per-channel share statistics, acknowledges batches, detects
//!   duplicate shares, and maintains best difficulty found.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Intended for use within mining server implementations that process SV2 share submissions and
//! issue `SubmitShares.Success` messages. Not intended for use by mining clients.
