/// When we receive SetCustomMiningJobSuccess we set in Upstream job_id equal to the one received
/// in SetCustomMiningJobSuccess so that we still send shares upstream with the right job_id.
///
/// The above procedure, let us send NewExtendedMiningJob downstream right after a NewTemplate has
/// been received this will reduce the time that pass from a NewTemplate and the mining-device
/// starting to mine on the new job.
///
/// In the case a future NewTemplate the SetCustomMiningJob is sent only if the canditate become
/// the actual NewTemplate so that we do not send a lot of useless future Job to the pool. That
/// means that SetCustomMiningJob is sent only when a NewTemplate become "active"
///
/// The JobDeclarator always have 2 avaiable token, that means that whenever a token is used to
/// commit a job with upstream we require a new one. Having always a token when needed means that
/// whenever we want to commit a mining job we can do that without waiting for upstream to provide
