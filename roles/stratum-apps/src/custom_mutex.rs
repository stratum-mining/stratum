//! # Custom Mutex
//!
//! This crate provides a thin wrapper around [`std::sync::Mutex`] with convenience methods
//! for closure-based locking.
//!
//! It exposes two main methods for accessing the inner value:
//! - [`safe_lock`] lets you run a closure while handling poisoned locks explicitly.
//! - [`super_safe_lock`] unwraps the result of `safe_lock`, panicking if the lock is poisoned.

use std::sync::{Mutex as Mutex_, MutexGuard, PoisonError};

/// Custom synchronization primitive for managing shared mutable state.
///
/// This custom mutex implementation builds on [`std::sync::Mutex`] to enhance usability and safety
/// in concurrent environments. It provides ergonomic methods to safely access and modify inner
/// values while reducing the risk of deadlocks and panics. It is used throughout SRI applications
/// to managed shared state across multiple threads, such as tracking active mining sessions,
/// routing jobs, and managing connections safely and efficiently.
///
/// ## Advantages
/// - **Closure-Based Locking:** The `safe_lock` method encapsulates the locking process, ensuring
///   the lock is automatically released after the closure completes.
/// - **Error Handling:** `safe_lock` enforces explicit handling of potential [`PoisonError`]
///   conditions, reducing the risk of panics caused by poisoned locks.
/// - **Panic-Safe Option:** The `super_safe_lock` method provides an alternative that unwraps the
///   result of `safe_lock`, with optional runtime safeguards against panics.
/// - **Extensibility:** Includes feature-gated functionality to customize behavior, such as
///   stricter runtime checks using external tools like
///   [`no-panic`](https://github.com/dtolnay/no-panic).
