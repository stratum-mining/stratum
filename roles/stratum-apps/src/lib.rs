//! # Stratum Apps - SV2 Application Utilities
//!
//! This crate consolidates the essential utilities needed for building Stratum V2 applications.
//! It combines the functionality from the original separate utility crates into a single,
//! well-organized library with feature-based compilation.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! ### Core Features
//! - `network` - High-level networking utilities (enabled by default)
//! - `config` - Configuration management helpers (enabled by default)
//! - `rpc` - RPC utilities with custom types for JSON-RPC communication (optional)
//!
//! ### Role-Specific Feature Bundles
//! - `pool` - Everything needed for pool applications
//! - `jd_client` - Everything needed for JD client applications
//! - `jd_server` - Everything needed for JD server applications (includes RPC)
//! - `translator` - Everything needed for translator applications (includes SV1)
//! - `mining_device` - Everything needed for mining device applications
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`network_helpers`] - High-level networking utilities for SV2 connections
//! - [`config_helpers`] - Configuration management and parsing utilities
//! - [`rpc`] - RPC utilities with custom serializable types (`Hash`, `BlockHash`, `Amount`)

/// Configuration management helpers
///
/// Utilities for parsing configuration files, handling coinbase outputs,

/// Custom Mutex
///
/// A wrapper around std::sync::Mutex

/// Key utilities for cryptographic operations
///
/// Provides Secp256k1 key management, serialization/deserialization, and signature services.
/// Supports both standard and no_std environments.

/// Share persistence utilities
///
/// Persistence implementations for share accounting events.
/// This module provides reusable handlers that can be used by any role (Pool, JD Client, etc.)
/// to persist share accounting data without impacting mining performance.
