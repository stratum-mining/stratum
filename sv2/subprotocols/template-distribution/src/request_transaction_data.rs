/// ensure backward compatibility, the transaction data **may** be encoded in a way that is
/// different from the consensus serialization of Bitcoin transactions.
///
/// The [`RequestTransactionDataSuccess`] sender **must** ensure that provided data is forward and
/// backward compatible. This way the receiver of the data can interpret it, even in the face of
/// new, consensus-optional data.  This allows significantly more flexibility on both the
/// [`RequestTransactionDataSuccess`] generating and interpreting sides during upgrades, at the
/// cost of breaking some potential optimizations which would require version negotiation to
/// provide support for previous versions.
///
/// Having some method of negotiating the specific format of transactions between the Template
/// Provider and the downstream would be helpful but overly burdensome, thus the above requirements
/// are made explicit.
///
/// As a result, and as a non-normative suggested implementation for Bitcoin Core, this implies
/// that additional consensus-optional data appended at the end of transaction data will simply be
/// ignored by versions which do not understand it.
///
/// To work around the limitation of not being able to negotiate e.g. a transaction compression
/// scheme, the format of the opaque data in [`RequestTransactionDataSuccess`] messages **may** be
/// changed in a non-compatible way at the time of fork activation, given sufficient time from
