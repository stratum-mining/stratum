//! # Stratum V2 Codec Library
//!
//! `codec_sv2` provides the message encoding and decoding functionality for the Stratum V2 (Sv2)
//! protocol, handling secure communication between Sv2 roles.
//!
//! This crate abstracts the complexity of message encoding/decoding with optional Noise protocol
//! support, ensuring both regular and encrypted messages can be serialized, transmitted, and
//! decoded consistently and reliably.
//!
//!
//! ## Usage
//! `codec-sv2` supports both standard Sv2 frames (unencrypted) and Noise-encrypted Sv2 frames to
//! ensure secure communication. To encode messages for transmission, choose between the
//! [`Encoder`] for standard Sv2 frames or the [`NoiseEncoder`] for encrypted frames. To decode
//! received messages, choose between the [`StandardDecoder`] for standard Sv2 frames or
//! [`StandardNoiseDecoder`] to decrypt Noise frames.
//!
//! ## Build Options
//!
//! This crate can be built with the following features:
//!
//! - `std`: Enable usage of rust `std` library, enabled by default.
//! - `noise_sv2`: Enables support for Noise protocol encryption and decryption.
//! - `with_buffer_pool`: Enables buffer pooling for more efficient memory management.
//!
//! In order to use this crate in a `#![no_std]` environment, use the `--no-default-features` to
//! remove the `std` feature.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! See the examples for more information:
//!
//! - [Unencrypted Example](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/blob/main/protocols/v2/codec-sv2/examples/unencrypted.rs)
//! - [Encrypted Example](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/blob/main/protocols/v2/codec-sv2/examples/encrypted.rs)
